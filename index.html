    <h3> A boy, a body of water and a fishing pole. </h3>

    <p> Having grown up in NW Indiana I had the "fishing bug" right from the start. I was fortunate to learn how to fish
    at an early age. Most of my fondest memories with my father all have to do with fishing in some way. I learned to not
    only love catching fish, but every aspect of the sport. Especially exploring! I drove my Dad to whits end numerous times
    when we were on a fishing trip insisting on knowing what's just around the corner, and the next corner, and the next
    of a creek, lake or river. This would eventually serve me well in Oregon!</p>

    <h3> This Hoosier finds Oregon </h3>

    <p>Focusing on a small snapshot of my "fishing career" so far in my lifetime, I would have to say that fishing in Oregon
    has been filled with the most variety to date. I never imagined I would encounter so many different species here. Actually,
    had you asked when I first moved up here when I got out of the Marine Corps I would have insisted there were only three! Salmon,
    Steelhead and Trout. Shows how much I actually knew about Oregon. Truth be told I've enjoyed pursuing over twice the amount of species
    I thought were here. A few examples are Salmon, Trout (diffreent varieties of these as well), Steelhead, Bass (both large and small mouth),
    Walleye, Sturgeon, and best of all, who knew you could make money catching fish (Northern Pikeminnow)!</p>

    <h3> Oregon and it's plentiful bounty in rivers and lakes </h3>
