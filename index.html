    <h3> A boy, a body of water and a fishing pole. </h3>

    <p> Having grown up in NW Indiana I had the "fishing bug" right from the start. I was fortunate to learn how to fish
    at an early age. Most of my fondest memories with my father all have to do with fishing in some way. I learned to not
    only love catching fish, but every aspect of the sport. Especially exploring! I drove my Dad to whits end numerous times
    when we were on a fishing trip insisting on knowing what's just around the corner, and the next corner, and the next
    of a creek, lake or river. This would eventually serve me well in Oregon!</p>

    <h3> This Hoosier finds Oregon </h3>

    <p>Focusing on a small snapshot of my "fishing career" so far in my lifetime, I would have to say that fishing in Oregon
    has been filled with the most variety to date. I never imagined I would encounter so many different species here. Actually,
    had you asked when I first moved up here when I got out of the Marine Corps I would have insisted there were only three! Salmon,
    Steelhead and Trout. Shows how much I actually knew about Oregon. Truth be told I've enjoyed pursuing over twice the amount of species
    I thought were here. A few examples are Salmon, Trout (diffreent varieties of these as well), Steelhead, Bass (both large and small mouth),
    Walleye, Sturgeon, and best of all, who knew you could make money catching fish (Northern Pikeminnow)!</p>

    <h3> Oregon and it's plentiful bounty in rivers and lakes </h3>

    <p> The first bodies of water I was able to explore the summer of &#39;95 after being discharged from the Marine Corps, were all
      small coastal lakes. The start of the fall salmon season that same year found me invited on an outing to pursue salmon for the
      first time. Towards the end of the day I hooked into and landed my first salmon. What a RUSH! I was hooked for certain and my
      learning of both the species and the rivers kicked into high gear. Along with learning my hunger for adventure and exploring
      kicked into high gear as well. I found myself numerous times leaving well before daybreak with only a map, compass and a
      strong determination to learn a new fishing hole or body of water to catch more of that delicous, elusive salmon! That lead to
      me discovering how much I loved being out on the rivers exploring, seeing things in nature that most people will never get
      to experience. Some of the rivers I've been able to explore extensively are the Clackamas River, Wilson River, Nestucca River,
      Salmon River, Satiam &#40; both North and South branches&#41; River, and the Nehalem River. More recently I've started pursuing
      bass in many of the lakes and some rivers like the John Day. The Cloumbia has become a fairly new fishery I've been slowly
      learning. That river is challenging with it being so large it's difficult to fish it from the shore. Overall I've mainly learned
      that I doubt I'll ever have enough time to fully explore all the fishing opportunities Oregon has to offer. That in itself is incredible
      realizing what a privilege it is living here!

     <h3> The <span>TRUE</span> joy that fishing has given me! </h3>

     <p> I've already mentioned how much my children enjoy fishing. What I haven't mentioned though, and purposely saved till last, is how
       much enjoyment I get simply from teaching others to fish. <span>Especially</span> children, and <span>best of all</span> are the
       children I get to help catch their first fish with their parents there to experience it right along with them. There's something
       about teaching and showing just that little bit of knowledge to them, then seeing the result. Not only in the first fish they
       catch! No, mostly in their eyes! That bright shining sense of discovering something new with that delight we treasure seeing so
       much in a child. Seeing the happiness in the parent's eyes that their son or daughter is so happy and has tasted success. Yes,
       fishing in Oregon could truly be considered being very close to paradise this side of heaven!
